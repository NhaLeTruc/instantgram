## 5.1.1

### Patch Changes

- :bug: Fix theus/instantgram#102

## 5.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 🐛 Bug fixes in stories and images.

  🔄🏗️ Transformed the code into a monorepo, added turbo repo and pnpm. Removed metalsmith from page generation and used astro build instead. These architectural changes aim to make it easy to fix future bugs and update the overall package (it was using an old node version and old/deprecated packages).
